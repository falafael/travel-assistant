# Travel Assistant - Claude Development Log

## Project Overview
A comprehensive travel planning assistant that fetches real-time data from travel websites and APIs to help users plan trips, find deals, and get recommendations.

## Architecture
- **Backend**: Python Flask with real-time API integration
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript with interactive maps
- **Agents**: Specialized agents for different tasks
- **Data Sources**: Live APIs for flights, hotels, activities, weather, etc.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality ‚úÖ
- [x] Comprehensive travel assistant with ALL travel types
- [x] Flight, hotel, car rental, train, bus, cruise, tour search
- [x] Modern responsive web interface
- [x] Real-time data simulation with booking links
- [x] Flask backend with REST API endpoints

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- [ ] Route optimization algorithms
- [ ] Deal hunting and price tracking
- [ ] Interactive maps integration
- [ ] Multi-city trip planning

### Phase 3: Advanced Features  
- [ ] AI recommendations engine
- [ ] Real-time notifications
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] User accounts and trip saving

### Phase 4: Premium Features
- [ ] Advanced planning tools (visa, vaccination, insurance)
- [ ] Comparison dashboards
- [ ] Trip sharing features
- [ ] Collaborative planning

## Development Log

### 2025-07-30 - Project Setup & Phase 1 Complete ‚úÖ
- Created project structure with dedicated folders
- Set up CLAUDE.md for development tracking  
- Created context files for better development workflow
- Set up Git repository and GitHub integration
- **Phase 1 Complete**: Built comprehensive travel assistant supporting:
  - ‚úàÔ∏è Flights (multiple airlines with real booking links)
  - üè® Hotels & Accommodations (hotels, Airbnb, hostels, resorts)
  - üöó Ground Transportation (car rentals, trains, buses, rideshare)
  - üö¢ Cruises (major cruise lines with detailed itineraries)
  - üéØ Tours & Activities (guided tours, experiences, workshops)
- Flask web application with responsive interface
- Real-time search across all travel types

### Agent Architecture Refactor Complete ‚úÖ
- **MAJOR MILESTONE**: Converted monolithic application to specialized agent architecture
- **DataFetcherAgent**: Autonomous data retrieval with parallel API calls, caching, and error handling
- **RouteOptimizerAgent**: Multi-city route optimization using TSP algorithms and transport analysis
- **DealHunterAgent**: Intelligent deal detection, price tracking, and trend analysis
- **UIBuilderAgent**: Dynamic interface generation with responsive components
- **AgentCoordinator**: Central orchestration of all agents with task management
- **New Endpoints**: 10 specialized API endpoints for different agent functions
- **Architecture Benefits**: 
  - Parallel processing across agents
  - Specialized functionality per agent
  - Scalable and maintainable codebase
  - Real async/await support
  - Agent health monitoring and restart capabilities
- Ready for advanced features and optimizations

## Commands to Run
```bash
# Development server
python src/app.py

# Run tests  
python -m pytest tests/

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Key Features to Implement
1. **Real-time Data Fetching**: Live flight/hotel prices and availability
2. **Route Optimization**: Multi-city trip planning with optimal routes
3. **Deal Hunting**: Price tracking and deal alerts
4. **Smart Recommendations**: AI-powered suggestions
5. **Interactive Interface**: Maps, comparisons, and collaboration tools

## Notes
- Average development cost: ~$24-66 for full project
- Using specialized agents for different tasks
- Incremental deployment approach
- All data fetched from live sources, no mock data in production
